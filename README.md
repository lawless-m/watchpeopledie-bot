For transferring youtube videos to liveleak

as suggested in /r/watchpeopledie

Complete
--------

Given a username, password, title, body text and filename the *liveleak* script will upload the file to Amazon S3 and then on LiveLeak, tag it with "reddit" and "/r/watchpeopledie", say it's from the UK (where I am), put it in the "other" category (because I will have no idea of the subject), give it a Mature rating and set it as happening today.

Scan Reddit for new posts using the Reddit API and download them from youtube using youtube-dl

Upload files to Liveleak that have not already been uploaded

TODO

* Post notice to appropriate Reddit thread
